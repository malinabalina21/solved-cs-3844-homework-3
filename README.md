Homework #3 – Convert numbers to Roman Numerals in Assembly

CS 3844 Section 0B1,

Given the shell of a C program, roman.c, write assembly code to convert numbers to “additive notation” Roman Numerals, as shown in en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals. For example, 44 in our notation is “XXXXIIII” instead of “XLIV” in normal “subtractive notation”. This is quite a bit easier to work with.

You cannot do any of the logic in C, other than what is already given to you.

Some hints and examples are provided in the roman.c file.

HW #4 will be very similar, but will go from a string back to a number.
